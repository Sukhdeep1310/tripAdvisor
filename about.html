                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Many people think that they'll only find the best flights or vacation packages on their own. Not true! Thanks to our longstanding partnerships with the world’s greatest travel companies, Travel Leaders Network travel agents have access to special pricing for cruises, air and tour packages, hotels, all-inclusive resorts and car rentals that you just can’t get on your own.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Should I purchase travel insurance?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Travel Leaders Network highly recommends purchasing travel insurance, as it protects your travel investment, health, belongings and vacation memories before and during your vacation. Most travel insurance plans cover trip cancellation, interruption or delays, medical, dental, emergency medical transportation, lost luggage, missed connections, itinerary changes and more. Most Travel Leaders Network travel agency locations have access to various travel insurance providers, so you’ll have plenty of great choices to choose from.</p>

                <button class="accordion">How early should I arrive to the airport?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>You should arrive at the airport a minimum of two hours prior to departure for domestic flights, and three hours for international flights. We strongly recommend reconfirming your flight time 24 hours prior to departure, for both origin and destination flights.</p>
